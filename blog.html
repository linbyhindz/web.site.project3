                <h1>My Motivation to Study</h1>
                <p>People love to say that learning must come from pure inspiration.
                    Mine comes from a simpler place: I want a good life.
                    Not yachts or diamonds — just stability, independence, and the ability to buy coffee without calculating my monthly budget in my head. Maybe even a job where I solve real problems instead of surviving them.
                    I do not always enjoy studying. But every topic I master moves me closer to a future where I choose my own path — not the one circumstances push me into.
                    So yes, I study to grow.
                    But I also study to live better.
                    And honestly, that is motivation enough.</p>
