                <p class="project-description">
                    In this project, our team constructed and tested basic logic gates (NOT, AND, OR, NAND) using a solderless breadboard, power supply module, resistors (330 Ohm and 2,000 Ohm), small pushbuttons, NPN transistors (PN2222), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and jumper wires. We built a NAND gate by combining an AND gate and a NOT gate in collaboration with Team 9. Additionally, I created an OR gate and documented the construction process in detail.

                    I not only recorded the step-by-step construction process but also narrated the video, explaining the working principle of each logic gate. The video demonstrates both the building process and the final output in action.
