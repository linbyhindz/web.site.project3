                            <p>Graduate of School No. 249.Since middle school, I have been passionate about exact sciences such as computer science, physics, and mathematics.This motivated me to prepare for the 1-st group's exams.

                            <h3>Programming</h3>
                            <p>In terms of programming, I am familiar with Python, basic C++ and HTML. While preparing for the SEC exam, I wrote over <b>100 Python programs</b> that solved fundamental mathematical problems. I have learnt HTML while preparing for the SEC exam as well. However, in order to learn C++, <b>Codecademy courses</b> were very helpful.</p>
